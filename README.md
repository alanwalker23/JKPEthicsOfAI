# Unveiling Bias in COMPAS: An In-Depth Exploration

## Introduction 
COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is a popular commercial algorithm used by judges and parole officers for scoring criminal defendantâ€™s likelihood of reoffending (recidivism). It has been shown that the algorithm is biased in favor of white defendants, and against black inmates, based on a 2 year follow up study (i.e who actually committed crimes or violent crimes after 2 years). In this project, we aim to detect and attempt to reduce biasness in the dataset. 

## Methodology  
1. Data Exploration - for initial exploration of the dataset
2. Preprocessing - for preparation of data and detecting biasness in dataset
3. Model_Regularization - for tool on limiting biasness
4. Adversarial_Debiasing - for 2nd tool on limiting biasness
